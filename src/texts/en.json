Gradually, it evolved and organized itself, and today it's part of a larger portfolio, built in NEXT.js 14, utilizing the latest features available.\nSome interesting challenges included: creating a modal for each video, with Route Intercepting and Route Parallel so that each project could be viewed without losing existing navigation, while also providing a unique route for direct access to each project; using the native Image component for better loading performance and server-side caching, reducing total immediate requests when accessing the site, making them only when necessary; in addition to route organization, as this project is contained within a larger application, which includes the site we're currently on.\nThis is a project I hold dear because it's, as mentioned, the beginning of everything and at the same time a logbook of my journey and evolution in front-end development.",

Although it's a mostly static page, there were some challenges that I found interesting to tackle. The first one was achieving harmony among the elements on the page, a way to understand and study programming concepts based on references from major companies. The second challenge was attempting to create, with limited knowledge and without the use of any libraries, an infinite carousel that can be seen further down the page. With elements that rotate independently of each other and with interactivity with the mouse and user control.\nThe goal was to get as close as possible to the reference, but some elements needed to be replaced and adapted, such as the fonts used and the removal of some sections.",

        "description": "This is a utility project that is widely used in Front-End development, specifically for design creation.\nUsing sliders and a real-time viewer, we can change values of properties that are part of the Box-Shadow and see the results immediately, greatly facilitating the implementation of this property.\nThe result of the control change generates a rule that just needs to be copied and added to the style rule to be used in the final project.",

Studying interfaces from major companies provides exposure to the work of top professionals and the best practices in the industry.\nIn this particular project, the focus is on HTML and CSS, with a small amount of JavaScript added to create the phone screen change in order to reproduce the original animation from that time.",
