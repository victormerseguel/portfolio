      "p1": "I am a Front-End Developer with a unique combination of technical skills and a refined artistic perspective. My journey began in the arts, where I graduated in Performing Arts and worked as a theater set designer and props artisan, earning prestigious awards in the field. This experience shaped my attention to detail and my ability to create visual solutions that balance form and functionality‚Äîqualities I consider essential for interface development.",
      "p2": "My introduction to technology was gradual and natural. Initially, as a hobby, I explored programming through Arduino, incorporating it into my artistic work. Later, while working in audiovisual production, I honed my logic and mastery of technological tools‚Äîskills that I rediscovered when diving into Front-End development.",
      "p3": "My passion for Front-End truly emerged when I followed the development of a website for my wife, which sparked my interest in technologies like React and JavaScript. Since then, I have turned that initial curiosity into a profession. Today, I specialize in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, React Native, Next.js, Git, and GitHub, with expertise in creating functional, intuitive, and visually impactful interfaces.",
      "p4": "With over 7 years of experience in design, audiovisual production, and digital marketing, I bring a creative and user-experience-oriented approach to my projects. Proactive, dynamic, and organized, I am always seeking innovative and effective solutions, combining logic and aesthetics to transform ideas into reality."

The second challenge was attempting to create, with limited knowledge and without the use of any libraries, an infinite carousel that can be seen further down the page. With elements that rotate independently of each other and with interactivity with the mouse and user control.\nThe goal was to get as close as possible to the reference, but some elements needed to be replaced and adapted, such as the fonts used and the removal of some sections.",

Studying interfaces from major companies provides exposure to the work of top professionals and the best practices in the industry.\nIn this particular project, the focus is on HTML and CSS, with a small amount of JavaScript added to create the phone screen change in order to reproduce the original animation from that time.",
